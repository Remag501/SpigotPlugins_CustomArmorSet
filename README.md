# SpigotPlugins_CustomArmorSet
Custom Armor Sets for battleground minecraft server.

Necromancer bugs/ideas:
- Can fly while controlling mobs after death state * 
- Randomly set on fire when flying dead *
- Keep hp right before dead after resurrection leading to almost guarenteed second death *
- Cooldown not working? (Works, resurrection message is off) * 
- Can hit mobs and pick up items while dead *
- add totem effect on revive? *
- Needs fine tuning: Armor set to netherite points, Lore set to question marks, 1.5x damage on undead mobs * (except 1.5x dmg)
- Disguise not removed on death *
- Weird glitch when taking over decaying mobs *
- Timer not working? *
- Add lightning
